# 1.5.0

# REFINED STORAGE HAS BEEN REMOVED IN THIS UPDATE

This was mentioned in 1.4.0. Do not update from 1.4.0 until you have migrated any Refined Storage system to Appled Energistics or Simple Storage Networks.

## Added

- Dank Storage, Quest Item & Modifications
- The Lost Cities -- Only accessible via its own dimension. New quest has been added under Mekanism to explain the process of getting there.
- Recipe for Kelp from Seagrass & Phytogro

## Updated

- Removed recipes for many different Create Addon items such as Alternators, Generators, etc.. as they were known for infinite energy glitches (and also I feel like Create power shouldn't be capable of generating RF/FE)
- Made Create Crafts & Additions Connector not placeable
- Tweaked the last few recipes for the Wormhole mod, correctly hid items that were not hidden from this mod but should have been (namely the Coal Generator).
- Crude Andesite Alloy Texture
- Angel Ring Texture
- Crude Andesite Alloy is now smelted into Andesite Alloy, rather than Sanded (to correspond to texture change)

## Fixed

- Furnaces not being craftable with most variants of cobblestone
- HT's TreeChop Chopped Log Block not having a localized name
- Angel Ring not being craftable due to the use of the wrong Brass variant

## Removed

- Refined Storage and All Respective Addons
- More Create Stuff; functionality of this mod was duplicate with Emendatus Enigmatica

# 1.4.0

# REFINED STORAGE WILL BE REMOVED IN 1.5.0

This has been a pack architectural design change that I didn't really have the foresight to plan for, but right now it's "deprecated" in this pack. What that means is that if you download this version, **your Refined Storage network will continue to work**. While it's working, get your stuff out and take a look at AE2 - you'll see that all Refined Storage items can be shapelessly crafting into their AE2 Equivalent, so you will be able to migrate freely and at your own leasure.

## Fixed

- Quark's Big Dungeons generating in non-overworld biomes
- Ender Dragon dropping Draconium Dust
- Ender Pearl Dust crafting incompatibilities / issues
- Towers of the Wild:
  - Generating with loot that they shouldn't (iron/gold ingots)
  - Generating too frequently

## Changed

- Refined Storage and all addons are now deprecated (see big note above)
- Passive entities will no longer seek cover / higher ground at night

## Removed

- Unused configuration files
- Inventory Sorter - has issues with Refined Storage even if deprecated
- Passable Foliage - in a quest, I recommend building an Ender Ender. I noticed that most people use Leaves, so this felt like an unfair mod to keep.
