# 1.1.2

## Added

- Torchmaster
- AE2 Infinity Boosters
- AE2 Wireless Terminals
- Stoneholm (Underground Villages)
- Curious Elytra
- Dynamic Lights

### Performance Mods:

- Magnesium (Major performance improvements with minimal issues so far as i can tell. If you have any visual artifacting or issues, report it on the issue tracker please!
- Magnesium Extras (offers some nice features if you go to Video Settings)
- Better Magnesium Video Settings

## Fixed

- AE2 recipes being uncraftable due to Emendatus Enigmatica Charged Certus not working like normal certus
  - When you throw any type of Certus on the ground it will automatically convert for you ðŸ˜„
- Some plank recipes not requiring saws / axes (Tinkers', Better Nether)
- Some quests being impossible
- Some loot chests not generating
- Any possible confusion with Customizable Elytra mod.
- Rod Recipes yielding Plates in Multiservo Press

## Changed

- Emendatus Enigmatica Certus Quartz and Charged Certus Quartz now drop the AE variant
- Hid all EE Certus/Fluix sthings
- Powah Ender Cores now only drop from Challenger Endermen
  - Challenger Mobs are now 5% more frequent
- All vanilla stone-like blocks now drop their Cobbled variant unless silk-touched
- All treated wood variants can now be wood-cut
- Changed BetterEnd versions - now on a different port to Forge entirely, might see some chunk borders in End Islands, just FYI

## Removed

- Colytra
- Spark (Incompatible with Magnesium)
- Unified Resources (To make my custom throwing logic work, plus AVSP scripts do what this does)
