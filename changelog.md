# Harmonious Engineering 3 Changelog

## [Credits](https://github.com/oitsjustjose/Harmonious-Engineering/blob/v3.0/CREDITS.md)

# 3.1.10

## Added:

- [`Mod`] Go Prone
- [`Mod`] Stack Refill

## Updated:

- Create
- Dave's Building Extended
- Elytra Physitcs
- Farmer's Delight
- Model Gap Fix
- Rex's Additional Structures
- Supplementaries
- Terralith
- X-Net

## Fixed:

- Redstone Ore not being processable in machines - this was my bad, I always forget that Redstone
  Dust is considered a `#forge:dust` when removing recipes in bulk..

## Changed

- Refactored the whole dang Ore processing cleanup script to be WAY more flexible. This may mean
  that some form of Ore/Raw Ore -> Dust/Ingot recipe was accidentally removed or left in. If you see
  anything suspicious, please report it
  [here!](https://github.com/oitsjustjose/Harmonious-Engineering/issues). This _also_ means that
  **Whole Deepslate Ore Variants now process into 3 dusts!!**. This was something previously
  difficult to implement but is much easier with my new system. Shame it still involves lots of
  manual entry, but `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯` what can I do.

# 3.1.9

## Added:

- [`Mod`] Model Gap Fix
- [`Mod`] TexTrue's Rubidium Options

- [`Quest Chapter`] **Palettes Aplenty**: _All About Building_
- [`Quest Chapter`] **The Dining Hall**: _Keep Yourself Full_

## Fixed:

- [Inordinate amount of Husk spawners](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/repurposed-structures-better-dungeons-datapack)

## Changed:

- Andesite Alloy now uses Zinc, because Zinc is overabundant when compared to how frequently it was
  needed
- Some structures from Rex's Additional Structures were culled:
  - End structures didn't generate propertly
  - Spawn Alters included some .. interesting choices in spawners, such as Zombie Villagers and Vex
  - Silverfish clusters were apparently added? Well, that was removed - no need to add that much
    malace ðŸ˜‹

## Updated:

- Compressed Creativity
- Create Crafts & Additions
- Dave's Building Extended
- FTB Teams
- Lootr
- PneumaticCraft
- Xaero's Minimap

## Removed:

- Shut Up Experimental Settings: Apparently Blueprint already does this!
- Personality: Confused players more than it helped

# 3.1.8

## Updated:

- Critters & Companions
- Decorative Blocks
- Framed Blocks
- Immersive Engineering
- Jade
- Simple Backups
- Snow Real Magic
- Supplementaries
- V-Tweaks

## Added:

- Compatibility Recipes for Thermal & IE Sawmill
  - Cocounut, Azalea, Walnut & Twisted Planks can be crafted via Sawmill.
  - Flowering Azalea can only be crafted via Thermal's Sawmill due to it not having a Stripped
    variant which is flowering (which makes sense -- once the log is stripped, the flowers come off
    too..)

## Changed:

- Recipes for the Advanced & Supreme Machine Frames are now cheaper
- Quest structures - most quests have been improved a bit :)
- Backpacked Backpack is now 5x11 rather than 9x4 - enjoy 19 more slots!

## Fixed:

- Exploit where you could Arc Furnace Recycle Metal Tools to get 3 ingots, when upgrading to that
  Metal Tier only took 1 ingot.
  - Unfortunately, IE does not properly support recipe handling for Recycling recipes, so I had to
    resort to disabling Arc Furnace recycling entirely. I'm really annoyed by this but for the
    foreseeable future there's not a better fitting fix.
- Issue where the wrong Steel Block showed up in JEI

# 3.1.7

## Changed:

- IE Drill Cores can be enchanted! This is done via Anvil, and regardless of what JEI says if your
  book has other enchantments _other_ than Fortune (I-III) or Silk Touch, it'll still work!

# 3.1.6

## Added:

- Villagers Sell Animals
- Magnesium / Rubidium Extras
- Simple Backups

## Removed:

- Oculus (and Flywheel Compat) - caused lots of visual issues with the Pressure Chamber. Do let me
  know if you disagree with this change, but even with shaders off I noticed several new artifacts
  not previously present.
- OK Zoomer - Redundant with Rubidium Extras
- Borderless Window - Redundant with Rubidium Extras

## Fixed:

- Bad Omen _should_ have been disabled unless obtained by burning an Ominous Banner. This wasn't the
  case, but should be fixed now
- Uraninite deposits shouldn't exist, so that's been resolved (thanks Elder Sign ðŸ™‚)

## Changed:

- All Deepslate Ores now have a chance of dropping a bonus raw ore (even without Fortune). This is
  to incentivise mining down at Deepslate as well as to give the impression that Deepslate Ores are
  "Dense". This incentive does not get passed on to those who silk touch ores -- silk touched ores
  cannot be processed to have this bonus as the tagging system in KubeJS isn't capable of
  subtractive tagging (i.e. "Every `forge:ores/iron` except `minecraft:deepslate_iron_ore`). If they
  offered this that'd be great but that's not the case ðŸ˜”

# 3.1.5

## Added

- Configured & Catalogue
- Functional Storage (Yes I _finally_ gave in - I've received lots of feedback on this!)
- Oculus for Shaderpacks if desired (Included Oculus compatibility for Create / Flywheel ðŸ™‚)

## Updated

- Compressed Creativity
- Create + Flywheel
- Create Crafts & Additions
- Critters & Companions
- Dave's Building Extended
- Decorative Blocks
- Flux Networks
- Immersive Engineering
- Little Logistics + Contraptions
- Naturalist
- Supplementaries
- Tips
- V-Tweaks
- X-Net

## Changed / Fixed

- All Minecarts now stack to 16
- Chest Minecarts (or anything that happens to drop a `minecraft:chest`) will now correctly drop
  Expanded Storage's chests
- Chest Minecarts not having the right Chest texture
- Creeper Confetti Tip - this has been replaced with an updated tip for Ungriefed Creepers
- Ender Dust can be dropped by Urns, though _very_ rarely
- Immersive Engineering's Plant Oil recipe being missing

# 3.1.4

## Added

- Borderless Window
- Ok Zoomer

## Removed

- Magnesium/Rubidium Extras Repo & Dev are inactive and current buld is breaking newer releases of
  JEI (thus holding back lots of important mod updates from other mods such as Refined Storage)

## Changed

- Creeper Confetti is now replaced by V-Tweak's Ungriefed Creepers feature -- creepers still
  explode, but blocks destroyed will plop right back into place (including tile entities!)

## Fixed

- Entities going missing in overworld and high TPS usage
- Beyond Earth's Oil Wells generating unnecessarily
- Non-water buckets showing up as water buckets in recipes in JEI

# 3.1.3 WAS REMOVED -- The custom MCFunction caused TPS issues and entities to go missing from the overworld somehow

## Added

- Multiservo Press recipes for Rods & Graphite Electrodes
- Neat new recipes for Levitation Lubricant!

## Fixed

- Fixed Apatite appearing - Thermal itself has not yet reimplemented Apatite Ore generation so I
  removed and culled all Apatite-based items and recipes
- Graphite Electrodes in the Induction Smelter recipe not working
- Graphite Electrodes via the Engineer's Workbench not crafting as unbreakable
- Some ores being tagged that shouldn't be - this should have no apparent change unless you were
  using the Laser Ore Miner, in which case you'll notice that Ruby & Sapphire are no longer
  generated
- Wrote custom MCFunction to disable misfitting mobs / entities on anoxic planets. Since it's a
  tick-based Function, you _may_ still see these mobs for 1-2 frames, but then they'll be warped
  away :)

# 3.1.2

## Added

- Induction Smelter recipes to recycle Netherite gear back into Netherite
- Recipes for IE Colored Sheetmetal variants
- Savage & Ravage compatibility pack for Repurposed Structures
- Smithing table recipes to upgrade bins - bins will keep their settings and contents when upgraded

## Changed

- Modification Station recipe has been flipped to make Shift-Click behavior work as expected
- Recipes for Thermal Machines now use a template so that it's easier to automate, making only four
  slots dynamic

## Fixed

- Infinity Backpack not showing its recipe when clicked in JEI

## Updated

- Dave's Building Extended
- Ecologics
- Framed Blocks
- KubeJS
- Pneumaticcraft
- RFTools (Base)
- Tempad
- Xaero's World Map
- Library Mods

# 3.1.1a

## Fixed

- Redstone Coils not being craftable in the Multiservo Press
- Redstone Servos having two recipes (related to above - got them switched up)

# 3.1.1

## Note:

If you're having issues with scrolling items into your Refined Storage grid and items going into the
Filter slot, go to `Options` -> `Controls` -> `Key Binds` and remove the keybind for
`Wheel item from cursor` and `Wheel item to cursor`.

## Added

- [Critters & Companions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/critters-and-companions)
- Easier recipes for Silicon & Silica Steel via Induction Smelter
  - This should help with FPS for those players whose bases are overcrowded with multiblocks.
- Integration between IE's Nitrate Dust & Thermal's Niter
- Jade Addons - will assist Jade in showing you things correctly, such as Create's Curved Tracks,
  Lootr chest contents, etc.
- JEI and More Overlays

## Updated

- Compact Machines (if you had issues with the Tunnels, try again now ðŸ˜Š)
- Dave's Building Extended (yay, new train building blocks!)
- Misc Libraries including McJty Lib & GeckoLib.

## Changed

- Meteorite loot table no longer includes steel
- Some Engineer's Decor machines being left in that weren't meant to be
- Added Silicon recipe for the Induction Smelter

## Fixed

- Lootr chests dropping Vanilla chests instead of Expanded Storage's
- Minimap quest existing still -- this has been placed with a reminder that Little Logistics exists
  :)
- Some quest chapters not appearing even though they look to be unlocked in the main
  `Research Progress` quest
- Some quests not having rewards
- Ultimate Chunk Loader only loading a 7x7x7 -- this was completely an accident.

## Removed

- Roughly Enough Items, for many reasons:
  - Fluid and Flux amounts not being shown in recipes
  - Hiding items being inconsistent and buggy
  - Recipes (such as for the infinity tools) outright not working unless viewed by looking at uses
    for the Dissolution Chamber
  - Occasional crashes and oddities
  - Quest book wanting to bookmark itself constantly, even though no one really ever did that
- Chunk Pregenerator:
  - Dev keeps removing old versions of their mod on their page, breaking many of my updates to this
    pack

# 3.1.0 - The Space Update!

## Added

- Beyond Earth: See the galaxy and beyond using spacecrafts! Quests have also been created for these
- Engineer's Decor: Not much has been modified via recipes, but a few things have been disabled and
  hidden as they mess with the balance of the pack
- Xaero's Maps: Map Atlases were being very annoying to use since they only work in the overworld,
  so I decided to go this route.

  but was forgotten D:

## Removed

- RubIE: a compat layer for IE and Rubidium. Rubidium has updated to include this by default!

## Added

- Tips mod

  - I wanted to disable Vanilla Tips, but I couldn't without breaking everything - so you'll also

    I've integrated
