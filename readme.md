# Still TODO

- ~~Remove darker depths iron smelting recipes~~
- ~~Make Compact Machines Harder~~
- ~~Redstone stuff mentioned above ^^~~
- ~~Change all Corail Woodcutter blocks to use a saw blade~~
- ~~Make ender storage use ender chest + enderium in smithing~~
- ~~Remove other mills from create until IE (use Steel)~~
- ~~Make drawer controller EXPONSIVE.~~
- ~~Push Powah to late-game, requiring something from Mekanism because really it’s ridiculous how OP that mod can be~~
- ~~Remove Powah’s cables. You’re grounded.~~
- ~~Remove Powah’s ender gates. Use Flux Networks~~
- ~~Balance Modular Routers~~

## All GP Tech Mods

- Create - Bare bones. You’re just getting started. It’s neat, but it’s all _you_ powered.
- Immersive - Getting there - now you can go steampunk at least
  - Rails, High Voltage and Diesel fill your world, for now..
  - Now you can use treated wood to start making other forms of mechanical power from create.
- Thermal
  - This will be your main “general purpose” tech mod if you want something electrical. Of course I encourage that you mix-and-match between your favorite mods or setups, but that’s just me.
- Mekanism. There’s a whole lot here. You probably know what I’m talking about. I’ll just leave this here and not mention anything about how impossible mek reactors are to get started with.
- Industrial Foregoing ... isn’t really “general purpose” but it’s definitely a contender. So yeah. It comes after Thermal _and_ Mekanism because of all of its **really** convenient features. They’re 100% lovely but you deserve to wait for them.

# Remaining Thoughts

- Mapping? I like Antique Atlas in an Akashic tome, do others?
- Patchouli Guide or FTB Quests (Or none?)
- Thoughts on making Stonecutting the main way to navigate around Refined Storage / AE2? Let’s say I make the interface recipe plenty difficult, but then you take it to a stonecutter to cut it down to an importer/exporter/etc.. for free. Does this upset you?
- IS THERE A WAY TO AUTOMATE THE SMITHING TABLE ?!?!? I love it as a crafting mechanic but it’s kind of rough to use if you don’t have a way to automate for late-game...
- Wormhole mod vs. waystones vs. carts - opinions? I Like the more minecarts mod and some wormholes here and there since Waystones are way too easy for a pack like this.
- “Nether” Quartz in the overworld - I love the idea, thoughts?
